Version 1.2.13

Updated for 0.98. Save compatible, if you're using your old save for some reason. Existing relic caches and derelicts will not contain the new relic items, but as always, they can be found with the historian or in scavenger fleets.

New for the Collective:
- Ultrachromatic Charge Launcher (large missile): Launches slow-moving and highly destructive energy bombs. Shield hits interfere with flux dissipation; armor hits cause EMP chain reactions.
- Sphaero Light Bomber: Cheap, fast, and disposable bomber drone equipped with unguided harmonic rockets. Three fighters per squadron.

New relics to find in exploration:
- Haynes-class Cruiser: ???
- Volatile Plasma Rifle (Relic, large energy): ???
- Laser Rifle (Relic, small energy): ???
- Laser Shotgun (Relic, medium energy): ???
- Laser Drone Pod (Relic, medium missile): ???

Changes:
- Aizawa/Dadras: Regenerative damper regen percent split by hull; Dadras now gets 3% missing armor/sec, Aizawa now gets 1.33% missing armor/sec. No longer provides maneuverability bonus.
- Coherency Amplifier: Now gives *all* energy weapon projectiles 50% of their base damage as EMP, not just Quark-Gluon weapons. (For technical reasons, the bonus EMP does not apply to flak-like explosions.)
- Networked Targeting Array: Reworked. Increases fighter, small, and medium weapon base range based on the amount of OP spent on weapons, but halves fighter engagement range. Maximum bonus is now 300 for ship weapons and 600 for fighter weapons, reached at 120 OP. Now costs as much as Ballistic Rangefinder, and is incompatible with it.
- Range Synchronizer: Loosened restrictions to match Augmented Range Synchronizer, and increased max range bonus to 50%. Clarified that it does not account for other changes to weapon base range.
- Sledgehammer MRMs: Decreased reload time on medium (15s -> 10s) and large (22s -> 15s).
- Shrieker Torpedoes: Increased small (1s -> 3s) and large (6s -> 12s) reload time. Reduced HP (250/300->200).
- LPDS Pod: Clarified that the flux dissipation penalty is flat, not percent, and increased it (33 -> 40). Decreased missile damage (500 -> 400). Slightly reduced fighter targeting priority; slightly increased high-damage missile priority.
- Wailer MRMs: Reduced armor strip (100 -> 75).
- Shatter Canisters: Increased submunition spread arc significantly (17.5 deg -> 24 deg)
- Plasmatic Repeaters: Increased bonus EMP damage on the fourth shot (300% -> 400%).
- Chameleon: Reduced gun range (1200 -> 1000).
- Arcspike/Arcstorm: Normalized EMP damage on hit and arc to 150 across all models.
Fixes:
- Hopefully fixed an issue where the Excession event could occur more than once.
- Some improvements to relic cache/derelict spawn locations; they should no longer spawn on top of each other.
- Spectrum, Backscatter: Removed carrier tag from cargo/fuel refits.

Version 1.2.12. Save compatible.

Major changes to the internal math for support hullmods, along with fancy new VFX. This is mostly intended to make them more viable for frigate/destroyer fleets and help avoid scenarios where it would be better to let an effect expire before applying a new one due to how the diminishing returns were calculated. The actual effect for fleets should be about the same as it was previously, and perhaps slightly stronger for cryocoolant builds. 

Other Changes:
- Removed hard dependency on LunaLib specifically to make Nes happy. If you really, really don't want to have that one button on the refit screen, you can remove it from the mod_info.json and the mod will work fine.
- Anole: Removed Resistant Flux Conduits, Insulated Engine Assembly, and reduced HP (750 -> 600). 
- LPDS pod: Increased rate of fire by 50%. Doesn't generate flux to fire, but reduces the ship's flux generation by 33.

Remote Support Hullmod Changes (warning: numbers ahead):
- Cryocoolant Projector: Improved VFX and reworked effect. Instead of providing a flat dissipation boost, it now adds to a "dissipation pool". The affected ship's dissipation is increased by 10% of the pool, and the pool drains by 10% or 100 per second, whichever is higher. The pool is soft-capped at 2000, which will give you about 16 seconds of buff if you reach the cap. Exceeding the cap uses square-root scaling (ie, you need four times as much coolant to reach double the actual applied amount).
- Remote Armor Patcher: Improved VFX and reworked effect. Similar to cryocoolant, repair blobs add to a "repair pool". The pool drains by 10% or 20 per second, whichever is higher, repairing the ship's armor by the same amount (if possible). The repair pool is softcapped at 400, and uses asymptotic scaling past that (ie, reaching double the cap is impossible, but adding more repair will always increase the pool). It's also now properly affected by timeflow bonuses.
- Nanolaminate Armor: No longer provides a bonus to repair received. Instead, increases armor repair rate by 50%.
- Cryocooled Armor Lattice: Reworded but the effect is the same: -33% repair rate.

Version 1.2.11
Changes:
- Fixed kinetic and energy VLS missiles having the wrong impact color.
- Fixed a spelling error.
- Anaconda: System duration extended (2.25s -> 2.75s) and beam damage reduction increased (33% -> 50%). Now pushes projectiles away instead of just slowing them down, which can result in shenanigans.
- LPDS Pod: Reduced OP cost (16 -> 14). Should no longer engage things in the fog of war.

Version 1.2.10: Bye Bye VRAM Edition

Overall: Added proper GraphicsLib shader integration. This roughly doubles the mod's VRAM footprint. It should have a very small performance hit if you were already using GraphicsLib, and no performance hit if you had turned off GraphicsLib shaders.

Changes:
- Added normal maps for all hulls and weapons.
- Added light data for weapons.
- Fixed a crash that could occur if the LPDS Pod targeted fighters that didn't have a parent carrier.

Version 1.2.9
New:
- LPDS Pod: Medium missile, relic weapon. Automatically fires loitering point-defense missiles that follow the parent ship and intelligently engage incoming missiles and fighters.
Changes:
- Aizawa: Over-cap damage reduction reduced (80% -> 75%), increased minimum requirement to trigger damage capping (more than 0 armor -> more than 15% armor)
- Nanoacid Cannon (small): Increased spread by 20%.
- Shatter Canisters: Improved ammo regeneration (60s -> 40s) and slightly tightened firing cone.
- Shrieker Torpedoes: Large version OP increased (30 -> 32). Reduced frag damage (400 -> 300) and HP (300 -> 250). Slightly improved ECCM guidance algorithm.
- Arcstorm (large Arcspike): Hugely increased submunition fire rate and dispersal angle. Increased ammo (10 -> 12).
- Significantly increased the amount of malware hidden in the mod (silent incompatibility removed, now emails your mom your browser history)

Version 1.2.8
Pushed out version that uses Magiclib 1.4.0, which integrates Combat Activators into Magiclib proper.


1.2.7a- save compatible
- Caedometric Flickerbeam no longer says that it can't rotate while firing (it could already rotate while firing, the text was just incorrect)
- Shrieker torpedoes no longer collide with friendlies, like other homing missiles.
- Slightly adjusted some mount arcs on the Dadras to improve broadside performance.

Version 1.2.7- save compatible
Really fucked up some of the relic generation code last version. It is fixed now. If you continue a save that you started in 1.2.6, please save your game before trying to open a relic cache because there's a non-zero chance it's bugged and will crash.

Since I feel bad about a bug like that, I have reworked the Excession to actually require a tiny bit of skill.
- You can no longer get two of them by doing the Nex start option.
- It's still vaguely similar (deal damage -> get juice -> use juice) but has some major changes.

Version 1.2.6- save compatible 
(new relic weapons will not show up in caches in existing saves)
New:
- incredible music by @haplogynae
- Caedometric Flickerbeam (in-faction)
- Nanoacid Foamer (pirates)
- Shatter Canister, Shatter Canister Pod (relics)
Changes
- Plasmatic Repeater: this wasn't supposed to be 20 op. oops. it's 24 now. also reduced sustained dps to 300 and efficiency to 1.1
- Wailer MRM: slightly modified spread parameters and reduced missile HP (175 -> 120)
- MHD Driver: was doing the math wrong; is now doing the math right. This is a nerf.
- Fusion Beams: Explosion radius is no longer capped, but now scales with a square root function instead of a linear one. Most explosions should be around 50-200 in radius, with ships like the Invictus going up to around 350.
- Light Fusion Beam: Reworked stats; the short burst and low beam velocity made it useless with any sort of range boost. Beam velocity is now higher and burst duration is longer; the explosion is unchanged.
- Tachyon Inverter: Fixed an issue with the sound that could occur at low amounts of time dilation.
- Relic derelicts are no longer pristine.
- All relic weapons and derelicts are no longer are guaranteed to spawn in every playthrough. Now spawns 2 derelicts and 6 relic caches. Ships got moved up a tier in historian drops, weapons unchanged.
- Added some hamster death causes for industrial evolution, and fixed some ships not being on the printing/reverse engineering whitelists.

Version 1.2.5- save compatible
- Rotary AM Flak: Improved vfx performance. Spam them more, if you desire.
- Wailer MRM: Increased frag damage to 400 (previously 300) since it felt a little lackluster for 13 OP.
- Fixed a crash that would happen if you fired Shrieker torpedoes at ships that were faster than them
- Fixed a crash with Wailer missiles that would happen if you were unlucky (honestly idk but it's fixed)

Version 1.2.4- save compatible
Just some fixes.
- Added version requirement for Combat Activators to prevent a crash if you didn't update it to at least 1.1.0.
- Toroid Mortars: somehow 0.96 broke the projectile glow on these? fuckin weird. anyway, it's fixed
- Shrieker Torpedoes: Reduced damage to 600 HE + 400 frag and increased targeting spread by about 20%.
- Aizawa and Dadras now have custom system AI and should be much more aggressive about using their dampers.

Version 1.2.3- save compatible (requires new save to spawn relic caches and derelicts)
Fleshing out the relic guns and adding some relic hulls. I don't have anything else planned for the relic stuff at the moment, but I'll add more if inspiration strikes.
New:
- MHD Driver
- Plasmatic Repeater
- Shrieker Torpedo Silo
- Shrieker Torpedo Rack
- Dadras-class destroyer
- Aizawa-class dreadnought
- Several relic weapon caches and hulls will be placed during sector generation.

Changes:
- Changed relic weapon/hull spawning- they now show up only in mercenary and scavenger fleets.
- added a loot cargo listener to ensure that Taipan VLS cells (and any other weapons with the SYSTEM tag) never end up in anyone's cargo, ever
- Rotary AM Flak: new sounds courtesy of meso, and significantly reworked explosion visual effects
- Wailer MRM Pod: increased flight time by 2 seconds to ensure it reaches its listed range even if fired directly away from the target. Reduced homing spread amount.
- Consolidated the Kommok and Odomodo bounties into a single bounty with a higher level requirement, difficulty, and a third weird Komodo. 
- Reduced the power of the Odomodo's damper to 90%. 
- Kommok and Odomodo are no longer guaranteed recoveries.
- Kommok now has Temporal Damper instead of Temporal Shell.

Bugs Squashed:
- Fixed a rare crash with the Wailer MRM missile AI.

Version 1.2.2- save compatible
- fixes an issue with the most recent combat activators version that caused some nozzle systems to never find valid targets
- cryocoolant manual targeting now considers a selected ally a valid target, even if they have zero flux
- harmonic dart cannon: improved sound and visual effects
- Taipan VLS: reduced ammo regeneration by 33%. Overbuffed this one last patch.
